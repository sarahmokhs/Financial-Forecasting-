# financial-forecasting-GBPUSD-exchange-rates
Time series forecasting of GBP/USD exchange rates using deep learning models

This project involves time series forecasting of the GBP/USD exchange rate using historical open price data from the past five years. The aim is to build and evaluate a predictive model for future trends based on past performance.

## Contents

- `financial_forecasting.ipynb` – Notebook containing data preparation, model training, and forecasting
- `GBPUSD_open_5year.csv` – Historical exchange rate data (open prices)

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Open `financial_forecasting.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Ensure `GBPUSD_open_5year.csv` is in the same folder
3. Run all cells to see preprocessing, model training, and predictions
